          <p>
             Namaste, I’m Samikshya Thapa from Nepal. I am a law student who values working with people from diverse backgrounds, an essential aspect of global policy, diplomacy, national and international law. I am driven by a deep commitment to empowering justice through the intersection of legal advocacy, ethical leadership, and cross-cultural collaboration.As someone who is actively engaged in sports and thrives in fieldwork, I bring energy, teamwork, and hands-on experience to everything I do.  My academic and personal journey is rooted in the belief that law is not just a tool for regulation, but a powerful instrument for equity, sustainability, and global cooperation. Whether engaging with issues of children rights, human rights, environmental policy, or digital governance, I aim to contribute grassroots advocacy that uplifts marginalized voices and fosters inclusive progress. With a global mindset and a passion for public service, I am working to shape a more equitable and sustainable world, one legal step at a time.

      <h2>“Why” I do what I do?</h2>
      <div class="two-col">
        <div>
          <p>I’m driven by a deep-rooted belief that every individual deserves equal rights and access to justice no matter where they come from, what they look like, or their circumstances. Growing up in Nepal, I witnessed the barriers many face when it comes to fundamental human rights, and it fueled my passion to make a difference. Human rights and social justice are at the heart of everything I do. For me, law is not just about rules; it’s a dynamic force for transformation. Through national and international cooperation and leadership, I aspire to bridge cultural divides and leverage the power of collaborative partnerships to build more inclusive and lasting global frameworks. Long-term viability and creative solutions in law will always guide my work, as I believe in addressing today's challenges while ensuring that tomorrow's generations inherit a world of equal opportunity. </p>
