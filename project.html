          <h3>Ethnographic Research</h3>
          <p>I was selected to participate in an ethnographic research project in Upper Gorkha, one of the rural villages in Nepal. Over the course of 15 days, we traveled on foot through challenging terrains to conduct fieldwork, gathering insights into the community's culture, lifestyle, and socio-economic conditions. After completing the research, the team and I compiled our findings into a comprehensive book. I had the honor of contributing one of my articles, titled "_____", which focused on Mount climber. This experience was incredibly enriching, as it not only enhanced my research and writing skills but also deepened my understanding of rural Nepal and the issues faced by marginalized communities.</p>

          <h3>Clinical LegalFIELD WORK</h3>
          <p>I had the privilege of attending and conducting a provisional visit to the Far-Western region of Nepal, where I had the opportunity to engage directly with the marginalized Tharu community. As part of a program organized by the Kathmandu School of Law, I conducted classes and awareness sessions focused on educating the community about their legal rights and the protections available to them under the law. The experience was both eye-opening and empowering, as I witnessed first hand the impact of informing individuals about their rights. By bridging the gap between law and underserved communities, I was able to contribute to their sense of agency and self-empowerment, fostering a more informed and proactive community that can advocate for its own rights. This initiative reinforced my passion for social justice and the importance of grassroots advocacy in creating lasting legal change.</p>
